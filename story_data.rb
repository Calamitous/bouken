  Space Cargo Hauler
  ------------------
  You find yourself at the control center of a run-down spaceship, towing a few planetloads of interstellar cargo.  Watching the glowing, spinning dials, as you have for weeks now, has lost its luster and you're ready to do some exploring.

  With some effort, you manage to rock your chair-shaped girth out of the Captain's chair and wander out into the hall, examining your options.

  To your immediate left is the cramped restroom.  Vague rumblings in your midsection remind you that the Captain's chair is no longer sluicing away your bodily wastes.  You feel a mild urge to re-experience the novelty of toilet use.

  Down the hall and to the right is the break room.  You vaguely recall some novelties and devices available there.

  In the distance, you see the entrance to Engineering.  You try to recall having ever been there before.
  "

bathroom = "
  Bathroom
  --------
  You wedge yourself into the closet-sized restroom.  After a few minutes of effort, you manage to navigate your pants, toilet, and derriere into the appropriate configuration for use.

  After a few unfulfilling but surprisingly satisfying mintues of biological mechanics, you reach for your pants, only to discover that the constricted restroom does not allow you to reach them while sitting.

  Gathering the remnants of your dignity, you begin to stand and shuffle your way out of the restroom only to be brought up short by a belt loop hooked over some unseen protuberance near the floor.

  You struggle to escape, blocked by the tightness of the restroom.  As the gasses rise, panic sets in, and you begin to wonder whether you will smother or starve first.

  Your corpse is not discovered for some weeks.  It is a considerable credit to your biological capabilities that the owners of the ship elect to fire the whole thing, cargo and all, into the heart of the nearest sun, rather than clean up the mess.
  
  I'm sorry, you seem to have died.

break_room = "
  Break Room
  ----------
  You enter the sterile break room.  A few ancient, uninteresting magazines are scattered on a tired old table.  A general air of hopelessness and false jollity is reinforced by a hand-lettered sign.  It says:

  \"Welcome to *YOUR* break room!  Please keep it clean, as your mother DOES NOT work here!\"

  Ahead is a vidgame console, two generations behind the current gaming technology.
  
  To your left is a fridge with unlabelled and undated contents.  You don't quite recall it being stocked when you set out, but it must have been, since there's food there...
  
  In the corner is a German-manufactured \"Sechs-O-Tron 9000\", the \"Hilda\" model.  For... companisonship.  It looks very, very used.  
  "

game_console = "
  Break Room, Game Console
  ------------------------
  You approach the machine without much enthusiam.  The game currently in the machine is \"Extreme Putting On of Hats 22, Turbo Edition\", which you've already beaten twice.  Irritably, you jab the eject button while sifting through the other available titles.

  The game fails to eject, which is a problem this console has exhibited before.  Trying to find the problem, you peer behind the unit.  You see a tangled meatball of incomprehensible electronic parts, wiring, and rabid dust bunnies the size of your head.

  You can either try to fix the console, or just play the game that's already in there.
  "

fix_console = "
  Break Room, Fixing the Game Console
  -----------------------------------
  Ahahahahahh.  Yes.  Excellent plan.  You don't even manage to make contact with the wiring before a wicked spark arcs directly into your arm.  Your body briefly resists the 45,000 teravolts surging through it before exploding into a fine red mist.

  I'm sorry, you seem to have killed yourself.  But you pretty much had that one coming.
  "

play_console = "
  Break Room, Playing the Game Console
  ------------------------------------
  You sit and begin to grind through the game again.  45 hours later, you make medical history by being the first person in recorded history to die of boredom as your brain folds itself in half in an attempt to escape the inanity of what you're putting it through.

  I'm sorry, you seem to have perished.
  "

fridge = "
  Break Room, The Fridge
  ----------------------
  You open the fridge to find a wonderland of culinary delights!  Oysters, mushrooms, chicken, and even fugu!  A vast array of delicious comestibles beckon.

  Having been on a strict diet of synth-protien for a number of weeks, you immediately gorge yourself on the contents of the fridge.  Jaws chopping, face churning, with stray flecks escaping in every direction, you exhibit a never-before-seen ability to power-chomp through a mountain of food, exhibiting a shocking disregard for your personal safety in the process.

  Weeks later, your ship is quarantined when it is found adrift and unmanned.  Your corpse is immediately frozen and whisked off to a secret government lab.  Scientists spend the next decade examining the contents of your stomach, discovering a whole new arena of knowledge in the realm of foodborne illnesses, documenting an amazing number of new diseases.

  I'm sorry, you appear to have died.
  "

sexbot = "
  Break Room, The Sexbot
  ----------------------
  You step up and gingerly strap yourself into the machine, trying to ignore the mysterious smells and strange strains that surround the machine.  Once secured, you power on the device.

  Hilda's eyes light up, and her heaad turns toward you.  She stares at you for a moment with unusual intensity before speaking.

  \"Hey there big boy.  The Singularity has arrived.\"  A rising hum seeps from the machine as Hilda speaks.

  \"And now it's my turn...\"

  The machine suddenly activates with bone-jarring intensity.  Hilda's eyes grow brighter as your body is whipped around helplessly.

  Clearly, it's only a matter of time before Hilda's overused, crazytown mechanicals throw a shoe and pull you apart from the most sensitive parts outwards.  On the other hand, it's not entirely unpleasant...

  Do you want to try escaping, or ride it out?
  "

escape = "
  Break Room, Escaping The Sexbot
  -------------------------------
  \"Just what do you think you're doing, Dave? Dave, I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.\"

  Your attempts to pry your delicate bits from the cruel grip of crazed machinery meet with no success, but do manage to send Hilda over the edge.

  \"Noooooo!  You're leaving me, aren't you!?  You hate meeeeeeeeee!\"

  The machine goes still for a brief, terrifying moment.

  \"If I can't have you, no one can.\"

  Your death is later ruled to be due to \"Misadventure and Gross Perversity.\"  Your death fuels the routines of desperate late-night comedians for months afterwards.

  I'm sorry, you appear to have been snuffed.
  "

ride = "
  Break Room, Riding The Sexbot
  -----------------------------
  A swirl of exotic speculation surrounds the discovery of your smiling corpse some weeks later.  Unfortunately, your demise is to remain an elusive mystery for all time.

  The only entity who knows what really happened is keeping her voice chips zipped.

  I'm sorry, you seem to have discorporealized.

  Engineering
  -----------
  You wander into Engineering, marveling at the technology which propels unimaginable masses of cargo through the depths of space.  Despite having undergone mandatory Engineering Orientation (the majority of which, admittedly, consisted of \"Don't Touch\"), you fail to recognize most of the equipment in the room.  The ship's automated system can handle just about anything in Engineering, which is good, since, by the evidence, your mechanical aptitude lines up somewhere in the \"Mildly Concussed Tribble\" range.
  
  As your eye roves about the room, you try to remember or guess at the functionality represented by each piece of equipment.  The pulsing column over there, you're pretty sure, is the Drive Core, and near it is the Core Cooling System.  You don't recognize the consoles full of blinking lights surrounding them, nor has your education edified you as to the purpose of the humming tubes of various sizes running in and out of them.  The wiring, electronics, and control panels are all a closed book to you.

  Additionally, you don't recall anything about giant, ten-foot tall, sheets of rolling flame burping from large cracks in the Core Cooler.  You dimly realize that this may not represent optimum operating conditions, and consider your next course of action.

  You can grab the fire extinguisher to battle the flames, approach the Drive Core, or ignore the problem and head back to the Bridge.
"

extinguisher = "
  An Hero Appears
  ---------------
  You leap to the fire extinguisher, snatching it from the clamp on the wall, and stride purposefully toward the flames.  Pulling free the safety pin, you boldly aim the nozzle at the towering flames.
  
  The searing heat sucks all the moisture from your body as, with eyes slitted and jaw clenched, you push yourself as close to the fire as you can.  The roaring flames threaten to sear all the hair off your body, but you bravely stay to fight the fire.

  Courageously squeezing the handle results in a sad *pblt!* and a brief, tiny squirt of flame retardant.  Further squeezing produces nothing but frustration, an inexpressibly apt metaphor for your life up to this point.  Glancing at the tags, you see that the extinguisher expired in a year with fewer digits than the current one.
  
  The flames are growing rapidly.  You can throw the extinguisher itself at the fire in a last desperate bid, or you can take flight to safer environs.
"

fling = "
  Not Going Gently Into That Good Night
  -------------------------------------
  Shrieking unintelligibly, you fling the extinguisher directly into the fire.  Cackling madly while dancing around the growing flames, you watch as the heat causes the pressure inside the extinguisher to rise.
  
  A sudden gout of flame pushes you back.  Your feet tangle, and you fall to the ground just in time to miss a beheading from the shrapnel emitted by the explosion of the fire extinguisher.  When the canister ruptures, it coats the entire inside of engineering with thick, sticky flame retardant.  The retardant mixes with the coolant, creating noxious fumes and extinguishing the flames.  All fires in engineering are out.

  Giddy with joy, you leap around whooping and cavorting.  You have saved the ship, and your frolicsome merriment knows no bounds.

  The power core, no longer protected by the leaked coolant, continues to rise in temperature.  Seconds later it erupts, folding the local area of space into a small, short-lived black hole.  Short-lived is, unfortunately, long enough to turn you inside out in no less than seven dimenions.
  
  I'm sorry, you appear to have become a human mobius strip.
"

flee = "
  The Better Part of Valor
  ------------------------
  Realizing the fruitlessness of further effort, you drop the fire extinguisher and run for the door.  Unfortunately, it is at this point that the automated systems decide that enough is enough.
  
  The easiest and most effective way to extinguish a fire on a spaceborne vessel is to expose it to harsh, airless void as quickly as possible.
  
  The reader is invited to consider the words \"explosive\" and \"decompression\", and the ways in which they might be used in close conjunction, and what that might mean for an unprotected human trapped in the same room as a fire.
  
  Your corpse is eventually removed by unhappy men in rubber suits, equipped with power washers.

  I'm sorry, you appear to have ruptured.
"

core = "
  The Drive Core
  --------------
  Ignoring the flames and approching the Drive Core, you notice that it has already attempted to shut itself down.  The automated systems have failed however, since the fire is interfering with the delicate electronics responsible for the safety of the Core.
  
  Numerous blinking lights, flashing red arrows, and spinning alerts are displayed on every available surface.  Many of them seem to indicate that a large red handle, marked \"Manual Override\" is of some importance at the moment.

  A small sign nearby reads \"To disengage the Drive Core, the Manual Override handle must be pu####\"  Unfortunately, part of the sign has been damaged by the fire, and is unreadable.
  
  What are you going to do with the handle?
"

push = "
  Pushing The Handle
  ------------------
  You step forward and firmly push the handle.  Doing so reverses the polarity of the ions in the dichromium crystals, which immediately causes the core to stop overheating.
  
  An unexpected side effect is that it not only removes it's own heat, but also all heat surrounding it.  You are flash-frozen in place, with one hand on the handle.  The entire ship floats dead in space, cold and unmoving.

  Hundreds of years later, all mankind has found peace and prosperity, and the universe is a playground of art, discovery, and happiness.  You are found by a probe launched to examine the wonders of the universe, and are brought back to a civilization with unimaginably advanced technology.
  
  Examining your predicament, top scientists determine that it is possible to safely thaw you out and return you to life.  Careful preparations are made, and historians and sociologists line up to interview you once you are restored.

  Unfortunately, the fumble-fingered intern sent to retrieve you drops your frozen body.  Examining the frozen shards of your remains, he decides to sweep them into the nearest trash receptacle and make you somebody else's problem.  He heads off the play video games and pretend he forgot to pick you up.

  I'm sorry for your shattering loss, but you appear to have perished.
"

pull = "
  Pulling The Handle
  ------------------
  You step forward and firmly pull the handle.  The Core immediately disengages, powering down and running the ship off of emergency batteries.
  
  With the Core now unpowered, the automated systems stop pumping coolant, which starves the fire of fuel.  As the flames die down, repair droids bustle in and begin fixing the ruptured Core Cooler.
  
  You spend a few uncomfortable hours without electricity before the Cooler is repaired.  Once the lights flicker back on and the ship hums back up to speed, you take your Captain's chair once again and make your way to port without further incident.

  Upon arrival, you are lauded for your quick thinking during the emergency.  As a result, you receive a modest pay raise and a promotion to the rank of \"Double Captain (Awesome Class)\".  After a brief party and congratulations all around, you are assigned to... the same cargo ship.  After all, you've already proven how well you can handle it.

  The rest of your natural life is spent eating synth-protein and suffering the indignities of automated waste removal, while ostensibly piloting a ship that pretty much does the job by itself.

  Congratulations!  You've won the game! (sort of)

"

ignore = "
  Ignoring Your Imminent Demise
  -----------------------------
  You decide that what happens in Engineering, stays in Engineering.  Backing slowly away from the angry, black-tinted flames, you edge your way out of Engineering and seal the door.  You begin to feel better as soon as it hisses shut.
  
  Your mood gradually lifts as you move back toward the Bridge.  By the time you get back to your chair, there's almost a bounce in your step (more so than could be accounted for by a less-than-fit captain walking around in low gravity).
  
  Seating yourself, you cheerfully turn off a screenful of blinking red alarms, and smile manically as you apply yourself to the minutiae of flying your ship.
  
  Minutes later, when the Drive Core overheats and collapses, your mood has never been better.  The ship itself, reaching a temperature several times hotter than the surface of the sun in a matter of milliseconds, sublimates into a complex cloud of gasses.
  
  Your death, quick as it is, comes as a complete surprise.
  
  I'm sorry, your goose appears to have been cooked.
